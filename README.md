# Kernel Cleaner 🧹

`kernel-cleaner` is a lightweight utility that safely removes old kernel files from `/boot`, helping systems with limited space (like Kali Linux) stay clean and updatable.

## 📦 Features

- Keeps only the **currently running kernel** in `/boot`
- Skips non-regular files and directories
- Logs cleanup to `/var/log/kernel-cleaner.log`
- CLI flags:
  - `--help` — show usage info
  - `--info` — preview files that will be removed
- Weekly auto-clean via `systemd`
- Includes a proper `man` page (`man kernel-cleaner`)

## 🛠 Installation

### ▶️ One-liner install via `wget`

```bash
wget https://github.com/GreyRhinoSecurity/kernel-cleaner/releases/latest/download/kernel-cleaner_2.0_systemd_help_man.deb
sudo dpkg -i kernel-cleaner_2.0_systemd_help_man.deb
sudo systemctl enable --now kernel-cleaner.timer
```

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
